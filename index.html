      <div class="nutrition">
        <h3 id="nutrition">Nutrition</h3>
        <p>
          Proper nutrition is complex, and exact recommendations depend on the
          individual. When determining the proper nutrition, you must consider
          your weight, height, age, gender and activity level. While the best
          nutritional plan is individualized, six major elements form the basis
          of all nutritional requirements.
        </p>
        <h4>carbohydrates</h4>
        <p>
          Carbohydrates are your body’s major source of energy. The fiber found
          in whole grains, fruits and vegetables also helps reduce your risk of
          obesity, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. The Food and
          Nutrition Board recommends getting 45 to 65 percent of your daily
          calories from carbohydrates. If you follow a 2,000-calorie diet, this
          means you should consume 225 to 325 grams of carbohydrates every day.
          Fat
        </p>
        <h4>protein</h4>
        <p>
          Protein has more physiological roles than other any major nutrient,
          according to "Nutrition and You" by Joan Salge Blake. Like
          carbohydrates and fat, protein can provide your body with energy when
          necessary, but it also helps maintain water and pH balance. Protein
          keeps your immune system strong and allows your body to move and bend.
          Foods rich in protein include meat, poultry, fish, nuts, eggs, milk
          and milk products. Women should aim to consume 46 grams of protein
          daily, while men should consume 56 grams per day.
        </p>
        <h4>vitamins</h4>
        <p>
          Your body needs vitamins to grow and develop. There are 13 vitamins in
          total, categorized by how your body absorbs them. The fat-soluble
          vitamins, which include vitamins A, D, E and K, need fat to be
          absorbed properly. The water-soluble vitamins -- vitamin C and the B
          vitamins, which include vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, thiamine, niacin,
          folic acid, riboflavin, pantothenic acid and biotin -- dissolve in
          water before entering your bloodstream. The recommended daily value
          for each vitamin differs, but it is important to consume all of the
          vitamins each day to keep your body healthy.
        </p>
        <h4>minerals</h4>
        <p>
          Like vitamins, minerals are substances that allow your body to grow
          and develop properly. Minerals are divided into two classes based on
          how much of each nutrient your body needs. Your body needs the major
          minerals – sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sulfur
          and chloride – in large amounts, while the trace minerals – copper,
          fluoride, zinc, iron, chromium, selenium, iodine, molybdenum and
          manganese – are needed in small amounts. The exact amount needed
          varies by mineral.
        </p>
        <h4>water</h4>
        <p>
          Water is more than a thirst quencher. It is a major nutritional
          element that helps regulate body temperature, lubricate your joints
          and protect your major organs and tissues. Water also helps transport
          important substances, like oxygen, throughout your body. Aim to drink
          at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water every day.

          <h3 id="social">Social</h3>
          <p>
            The social determinants of health (SDH) are the non-medical factors
            that influence health outcomes. They are the conditions in which
            people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of
            forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life. These
            forces and systems include economic policies and systems,
            development agendas, social norms, social policies and political
            systems. The SDH have an important influence on health inequities -
            the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within
            and between countries. In countries at all levels of income, health
            and illness follow a social gradient: the lower the socioeconomic
            position, the worse the health. The following list provides examples
            of the social determinants of health, which can influence health
            equity in positive and negative ways:
          </p>
          <p>
            Income and social protection, Education, Unemployment and job
            insecurity ,Working life conditions, Food insecurity, Housing basic
            amenities and the environment ,Early childhood development, Social
            inclusion and non-discrimination, Structural conflict, Access to
            affordable health services of decent quality.

      <div class="environment">
        <h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>

        <p>
          The truth is, it’s challenging to pin down exactly what factors cause
          an environmental health problem. Health problems related to the
          environment are complex and develop for a variety of reasons,
          including how likely a person’s genes are to develop a disease or
          condition (scientists call this genetic susceptibility). What we do
          know is that an environmental health problem is likely linked to
          physical, biological and even economic factors.

      <div class="emotion">
        <h3 id="emotion">Emotion</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional health is one aspect of mental health. It is your ability to
          cope with both positive and negative emotions, which includes your
          awareness of them. Emotionally healthy people have good coping
          mechanisms for negative emotions, and they also know when to reach out
          to a professional for help. Emotional wellness is tied to physical
          health. People who experience great amounts of stress and negative
          emotions will sometimes develop other health problems. These problems
          are not caused directly by the negative feelings, but by behaviors
          that negative emotions can influence due to a lack of emotional
          regulation. For example, some people enjoy smoking cigarettes or
          drinking alcohol as a way to relieve stress. However, those habits put
          you at a greater risk for cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses.
          Keep in mind that a person can experience mental illness or bad days,
          and still have good emotional wellness. Mental illnesses often have
          deeper causes like a chemical imbalance or trauma. Emotional health
          has more to do with emotional regulation, awareness, and coping
          skills, and these strategies can be used by people with or without a
          mental illness.
